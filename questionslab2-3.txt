[1. What would happen the performance of the login method if we
had many more users, say 1 million, and why?]

  If the login method's search algorithm is not fast enough, it
  will take a longer time querying the database to check that the
  proper credentials match

[2. What can we do to ensure logging in will be fast even with a
large number of users?]

  We would need a better search algorithm and/or a look up table. In addition,
  the validation should be performed locally on client computers.
