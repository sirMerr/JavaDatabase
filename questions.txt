Questions:

1. How should you handle printing books with multiple authors?

The same way we normally would (while (rs.next())), since only
the authors change, and so we can retrieve data that way.

2. How should we handle incorrect input? How do we protect the integrity of our data against SQLErrors,
  connection problems, or race conditions?

We can ensure that the input does not already exist in our
database. We can also make sure to try/catch any possible
SQL exception and close the connection.

3. How should we handle incorrect input?
  What should happen if a book has an author or genre that isnâ€™t already in the database?
  What should happen if the author or genre is already present?
  What should happen if a book has multiple authors?
  How do we protect the integrity of our data against SQLErrors, connection problems, or race conditions?

We can ensure that the input does not already exist in our
database. If the author or genre is already present, the method
should not create anything. If it has multiple authors, we will add it to a
premade list. We can also make sure to try/catch any possible
SQL exception and close the connection.
